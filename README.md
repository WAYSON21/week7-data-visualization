Step 1: Loads the iris.data dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Step 2: Displays the first few rows using head() to inspect the data.

Step 3: Checks for any missing values and outputs the data types using info() and isnull().sum().

Step 4: Drops any rows with missing values using dropna().

Task 2: Provides basic statistics for the dataset, computes the mean values for each species using groupby(), and prints the observations about the dataset.

Task 3: Creates visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Line chart: Shows the average petal length per species.

Bar chart: Compares the average sepal width across species.

Histogram: Shows the distribution of petal length.

Scatter plot: Displays the relationship between sepal length and petal length, differentiated by species.
